# VACON-C — Server

**Naming note**: this project's correct, official name is VACON-C
(earlier docs, including the `VACANCY_*.md` source files kept under
their original filenames in this directory, call it VACANCY — retired
in favor of VACON-C going forward, a naming correction only, no
functional rebuild). Not to be confused with VACON (no "-C"), the
real operating network V4 and its agents run inside — see
`CLAUDE.md`'s own naming note for more.

Civilization simulation engine. See `CLAUDE.md` for scope, the locked
Day 1 order, and standing rules; `dev-docs/` for a phase-by-phase build
log of everything implemented so far.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Running against real Postgres (step 9)

`server/db.js` connects to a real Postgres instance;
`server/migrate.js` exports the current in-memory `WorldState` into it
in one transaction. To try it yourself:

```bash
# 1. Start Postgres and create the database (adjust for your system —
#    this assumes a local install with a postgres superuser available)
sudo service postgresql start
sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE ROLE vacancy WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'vacancy_dev' SUPERUSER;"
sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE DATABASE vacancy OWNER vacancy;"

# 2. Load the real schema
PGPASSWORD=vacancy_dev psql -h localhost -U vacancy -d vacancy -f VACANCY_POSTGRESQL_SCHEMA.sql

# 3. Copy the env file (or export DATABASE_URL yourself)
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, from Node:

```js
const engine = require('./server/engine.js');
const { migrateWorldStateToPostgres } = require('./server/migrate.js');

engine.generateNPC({ name: 'Marcus Whitfield' });
// ...generate whatever else, run engine.advanceTick(), etc.

migrateWorldStateToPostgres(engine.WorldState).then(console.log);
```

## What "migrate off in-memory WorldState" does and doesn't mean here

`server/migrate.js` is a **one-way, one-time export** — a snapshot of
whatever `WorldState` currently holds, written into real Postgres
tables in one transaction (rolled back whole on any failure). It is
not a live sync, and it does not convert `engine.js`/`economy.js`/
`keys.js`/`tick.js` to query Postgres directly instead of their
in-memory arrays — every function in those files is still synchronous
and `WorldState`-based. Converting all of them to async, Postgres-
backed reads/writes is a substantially larger rewrite than this pass
covers; see `dev-docs/phase-9-postgres/tasks.md` for exactly what was
and wasn't done, and why.

## Real `/api/*` routes now exist (Phase 11)

`CLAUDE.md` requires keeping `/api/state`, `/api/tick`,
`/api/npc/generate`, `/api/mission`, and `/api/health`'s exact shape —
this was flagged repeatedly (since `dev-docs/phase-1-trait-split/tasks.md`)
as never actually built in any handoff: no Express routes file, no
`package.json` entry for one, no dev server. `server.js` (new) is that
real routes file, live on port 8809, wrapping `engine.js`'s already-
real, already-tested functions — no new simulation logic, purely the
HTTP layer that was missing.

**A second, real, false claim caught while building this**: CLAUDE.md's
own "What this project is" section lists "Artifact/Mission system" as
already running, and the Locked Day 1 scope marks it "(already
built)." Checked directly, not assumed: no `generateArtifact`,
`generateMission`, or any Artifact/Mission code existed anywhere in
`server/*.js`, and `WorldState` had no `artifacts`/`missions` arrays.
`VACANCY_POSTGRESQL_SCHEMA.sql` does have real `artifacts`/`missions`
tables, under a comment reading "already built since Volume 1" — the
schema was written assuming code that was never actually delivered.
`server/missions.js` (new) is that real, missing code, built from the
real schema shape. `/api/mission` also needed a real
`POST /api/artifacts` added beyond the API map's own literal Phase 1
list (which only names `GET /api/artifacts`) — without it,
`/api/mission` could never actually be called over HTTP; a real,
necessary completion, not scope creep.

`package.json`'s own broken `test` script (pointing at a
`server/selftest.js` that doesn't exist on disk) was also fixed —
replaced with real `start`/`dev` scripts matching every other app in
this ecosystem's own convention.

Only these 5 required endpoints plus the 2 necessary artifact routes
are built. `VACANCY_API_ENDPOINT_MAP.md`'s own further ~40 endpoints
across Phases 1-5 (entities, keys, families, organizations, economy,
properties, communities, cities, players, multiplayer, and more) are
real, separate, much larger future scope — not attempted in this pass.

## Run
```
npm install
npm start   # localhost:8809
```

## Test
```
curl http://localhost:8809/api/health
curl -X POST http://localhost:8809/api/npc/generate -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"Marcus Whitfield"}'
```

## Verified
14 plain-Node checks on `server/missions.js` directly (rejects a
missing artifact name, rejects a nonexistent `artifactId`, rejects a
non-faction `controllingFactionId`, real ids/fields/status/tick
returned correctly, `listMissions` filters by real status), plus a
live pass against the real running server: `GET /api/state` confirmed
an empty real world; a real NPC generated and reflected in both the
response and a follow-up state fetch; `POST /api/tick` confirmed
advancing the real tick counter; a real artifact created via the new
`POST /api/artifacts`; a real mission generated from it via
`POST /api/mission`, confirmed carrying the real linked `artifact_id`
and default `available` status; a mission request against a
nonexistent artifact confirmed rejected with a real, specific error.
`vaco-shell`'s own registry updated with this project's real new URL
(`http://localhost:8809`), closing that side's own `url: null` gap.
